# Terraria Dataset

## Introduction

In this repository you can find almost everything about Terraria's game datain JSON files. Everything were scrapped from [Terraria Gamepedia
Wiki](https://terraria.gamepedia.com/) (Cheers!). Mainly this entire project was built in to get it integrated to a
Discord Wiki Bot, although as all this data can be useful for some others API, my intention is to get them available if anyone
else wants to use it.

All the codes written during the entire scrap can be found inside 'algorithms' directory on 'dev' branch. It's also
convenient to point that all of this work were made with pourpose of learning Python and understanding how do web scraping 
works, so I could say I'm kinda happy with the results.

## Authors

All the information were scrapped using Python's web-scraping scripts/libraries by
[me](https://github.com/natan-dot-com) and [Andrei Alisson](https://github.com/AndreiAlisson).
