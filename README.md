# Terraria Dataset

## Introduction

In this repository you can find data JSON files from the game Terraria. Everything scrapped from [Terraria Gamepedia
Wiki](https://terraria.gamepedia.com/) (Cheers!). Mainly this entire project was built in to get it integrated to a
Discord Wiki Bot, but as all this data can be useful for some others API my intention is to get them available if anyone
else wants to use it.

All the codes written during the entire scrap can be found inside 'data\_scrapping\_algorithms' directory. It's also
convenient to say that all of this work were made with pourpose of learning Python and understanding how do web scrapping 
works, so I could say I'm kinda happy with the results.

## Authors

All the information were scrapped using Python's web-scrapping scripts/libraries by
[me](https://github.com/natan-dot-com) and [Andrei Alisson](https://github.com/AndreiAlisson).
