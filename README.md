# Terraria Dataset

## Introduction

In this repository you can find data JSON files from the game Terraria. Everything scrapped from [Terraria Gamepedia
Wiki](https://terraria.gamepedia.com/) (Cheers!). Mainly this entire project was built in to get it integrated to a
Discord Wiki Bot. As all this data can be useful for some others API, my intention is to get them available if someone
else wants to use it.

# Authors

All the information were scrapped using Python's web-scrapping scripts/libraries by
[me](https://github.com/natan-dot-com) and [Andrei Alisson](https://github.com/AndreiAlisson).
